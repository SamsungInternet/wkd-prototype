Accessibility is a vital part of any online experience, and here is what we're doing to make sure that is the case for you:

* Designing things with accessibility in mind.
* Bearing in mind best practice when developing the site.
* Regularly having users try to use the site, to find any barriers that may exist.
* Performing regular accessibility audits.
* Investing in training our team, so that they can build up their accessible design and development skills.
